CET Color Maps were developed by Peter Kovesi and released under CC-BY 4.0

The cetcolor package provides an integration of the CET color maps into R.
cetcolor accomplishes this by supplying graphic functions, examples, and more.
The R implementation was done by James Joseph Balamuta with additional
contributions by contributors listed in the ChangeLog.
